Once ansible is installed then go to cd .ansible
create a hosts file and add all servers you want to do changes or install softwares. pwd - /root/.ansible/hosts
we can add groups and add servers in the groups
[weservers]
18.206.161.146
54.166.16.51
you can add an id address in any group or n num of groups

[dbservers]
18.206.161.146
54.166.16.51
ansible --help
now you can check if you are able to connect to other servers using ansible command
for ubuntu users command is ansible webservers -u ubuntu --become-user=root --become-method=sudo -b -m ping
for root users ansible webservers -m ping
to install apache ansible webservers -m apt -a "name=apache2"
webersers is group name, -u is which user you want to login as , there is something called become user, 
if you have to install softwares then ubuntu cannot do that , you will have to be root user to do the changes on other mechines
using sudo ubuntu user become root user, -b to become root user to execute commands , -m is module , we have to specify what we want to do so using ping to ping on servers.
when you execute anbile webservers -m ping , we may get error if ansible couldnt read hosts file, so we have to configure in ansible.cfg
we have to tell ansible that where is ansible located and we have to give the inventoryfile path.
when you install ansible a config file will be created that is ansible.cfg
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
copy ansible.cfg to current folder that is .ansible , cp /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg . and if required hosts file as well to current folder that is .ansible cp /etc/ansible/hosts .
and we have to remove # (uncomment) for host_key checking = False, this is because to avoid login errors while we try logging into other linux mechines
